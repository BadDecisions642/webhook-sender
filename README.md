# webhook-sender
Webhook Sender ran in terminal, no longer requires a avatar url you can change it from integrations on your discord server, of course no webhooks are send to me.. i dont know why they would be but i assume its reassuring that i say that, i dont care if it doesnt work for you its an issue on your behalf as it works for me and my friends just fine. you can it in the vsc (visual studio code) terminal too, i dont see why it wouldnt but hey i suppose thats it, if i update it then i will make another update here but i doubt i will, no changes are really neccessary, if i spelt something wrong its because im tired and i dont care for something as simple as a grammar error on github for crying out loud
